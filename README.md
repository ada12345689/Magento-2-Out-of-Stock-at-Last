# Magento-2-Out-of-Stock-at-Last

Magento 2 Out of Stock at Last Extension will move all the out-of-stock products away from the visitor’s sight in order to catch their attention on the available products so as to boost conversions.

As soon as the user lands on your website and searches for products, all they get to see are sold-out products. This has a direct impact on the user experience of the store and you will notice conversion dropdowns. Removing unavailable products from the product grid is one option to not hamper the user’s browsing journey. But MageComp has a better solution to handle out-of-stock products where the admin need not to even remove the products from the store.
